# BERT Resume Classifier (Fine-Tuned)

This model is a fine-tuned version of `bert-base-uncased` on a custom resume dataset containing resume texts and their associated job categories. It is designed to classify a resume into categories such as **Data Science**, **Web Development**, **HR**, and others.

---

## 📌 Model Details

- **Base Model:** [bert-base-uncased](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased)
- **Architecture:** BERT + Classification Head
- **Task:** Multi-class Text Classification
- **Dataset Used:** Kaggle Resume Dataset (2 columns: `resume`, `category`)
- **Training Framework:** HuggingFace Transformers + Trainer API
- **Language:** English

---

## 🧠 Use Case

Given a resume in plain text format, this model predicts the **most suitable job category**.

**Example:**

```python
resume = "Experienced web developer skilled in JavaScript, React, and Node.js..."
````

**Predicted category:** `Web Development`

---

## 📊 Evaluation

**Training Results**

* **Epochs:** 3
* **Training Loss:** 1.200
* **Validation Loss:** 1.046
* **Accuracy:** \~84% on validation set

The model shows good generalization and classification performance across categories.

## 🔬 How to Use

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification

# Load model
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("your-username/bert-resume-classifier")
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained("your-username/bert-resume-classifier")

# Prepare input
inputs = tokenizer("Resume text goes here...", return_tensors="pt", truncation=True, padding=True)

# Predict
outputs = model(**inputs)
pred = outputs.logits.argmax().item()
```

---

## 🚀 Training Details

* Trained for **3 epochs** on custom resume dataset (80/20 train-validation split)
* Batch size: 8
* Loss Function: Cross Entropy Loss
* Optimizer & Scheduler: HuggingFace Trainer default
* Framework: PyTorch + HuggingFace Transformers

---

## 📁 Files Included

* `pytorch_model.bin` – Fine-tuned model weights
* `config.json` – Model architecture config
* `tokenizer/` – Tokenizer files (vocab, special tokens)
* `training_args.bin` – Trainer settings (optional)

## 🧪 Example Inference

```python
resume_text = """
Machine learning engineer with 3+ years experience building NLP and CV models using PyTorch and TensorFlow. 
Deployed models to AWS, wrote data pipelines in Spark, and built dashboards with Streamlit.
"""
inputs = tokenizer(resume_text, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True, padding=True)
outputs = model(**inputs)
predicted_class = outputs.logits.argmax().item()
print("Predicted Category:", predicted_class)
```
