# BERT Resume Classifier (Fine-Tuned)

This model is a fine-tuned version of `bert-base-uncased` on a custom resume dataset containing resume texts and their associated job categories. It is designed to classify a resume into categories such as **Data Science**, **Web Development**, **HR**, and others.

---

## 📌 Model Details

- **Base Model:** [bert-base-uncased](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased)
- **Architecture:** BERT + Classification Head
- **Task:** Multi-class Text Classification
- **Dataset Used:** Kaggle Resume Dataset (2 columns: `resume`, `category`)
- **Training Framework:** HuggingFace Transformers + Trainer API
- **Language:** English

---

## 🧠 Use Case

Given a resume in plain text format, this model predicts the **most suitable job category**.

Example:

```python
resume = "Experienced web developer skilled in JavaScript, React, and Node.js..."
````

Predicted category: `Web Development`

## 📊 Evaluation

| Metric          | Value                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------- |
| Training Loss   | 1.200                     |
| Validation Loss | 1.046                     |
| Accuracy        | \~84% (on validation set) |
| Epochs          | 3                         |

The model shows good generalization and classification performance across categories.

## 🔬 How to Use

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification

# Load model
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("your-username/bert-resume-classifier")
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained("your-username/bert-resume-classifier")

# Prepare input
inputs = tokenizer("Resume text goes here...", return_tensors="pt", truncation=True, padding=True)

# Predict
outputs = model(**inputs)
pred = outputs.logits.argmax().item()
```

## 🛠 What You Can Change

Let me know if:
- Your categories are different (I can modify the label section).
- You want to include a sample resume dataset or notebook link.
- You want me to generate a Hugging Face `model card` version (`README.md` gets auto-converted).

Want me to zip this into a file you can upload directly to Hugging Face/GitHub?
